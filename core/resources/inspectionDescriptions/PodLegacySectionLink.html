Previous versions of perlpod allowed for a <code>L&lt;section&gt;</code> syntax (as in
<code>L&lt;Object Attributes&gt;</code>), which was not easily distinguishable from
<code>L&lt;name&gt;</code> syntax and for <code>L&lt;&quot;section&quot;&gt;</code> which was only
slightly less ambiguous.
<br>
This syntax is no longer in the specification, and
has been replaced by the <code>L&lt;/section&gt;</code> syntax (where the slash was
formerly optional).
