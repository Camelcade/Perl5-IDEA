 </h2><p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or
other text which does not require any special parsing or formatting,
and which shouldn't be wrapped.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character
be a space or a tab.  (And commonly, all its lines begin with spaces
and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to
be on 8-column boundaries.  There are no special formatting codes,
so you can't italicize or anything like that.  A \ means \, and
nothing else.</p>
