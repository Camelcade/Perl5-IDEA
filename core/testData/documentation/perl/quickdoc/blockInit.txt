    </h2><p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Five specially named code blocks are executed at the beginning and at
the end of a running Perl program.  These are the <code>BEGIN</code>,
<code>UNITCHECK</code>, <code>CHECK</code>, <code>INIT</code>, and <code>END</code> blocks.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">These code blocks can be prefixed with <code>sub</code> to give the appearance of a
subroutine (although this is not considered good style).  One should note
that these code blocks don't really exist as named subroutines (despite
their appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that you can
have <B>more than one</B> of these code blocks in a program, and they will get
<B>all</B> executed at the appropriate moment.  So you can't execute any of
these code blocks by name.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">A <code>BEGIN</code> code block is executed as soon as possible, that is, the moment
it is completely defined, even before the rest of the containing file (or
string) is parsed.  You may have multiple <code>BEGIN</code> blocks within a file (or
eval'ed string); they will execute in order of definition.  Because a <code>BEGIN</code>
code block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions of subroutines
and such from other files in time to be visible to the rest of the compile
and run time.  Once a <code>BEGIN</code> has run, it is immediately undefined and any
code it used is returned to Perl's memory pool.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">An <code>END</code> code block is executed as late as possible, that is, after
perl has finished running the program and just before the interpreter
is being exited, even if it is exiting as a result of a die() function.
(But not if it's morphing into another program via <code>exec</code>, or
being blown out of the water by a signal--you have to trap that yourself
(if you can).)  You may have multiple <code>END</code> blocks within a file--they
will execute in reverse order of definition; that is: last in, first
out (LIFO).  <code>END</code> blocks are not executed when you run perl with the
<code>-c</code> switch, or if compilation fails.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Note that <code>END</code> code blocks are <B>not</B> executed at the end of a string
<code>eval()</code>: if any <code>END</code> code blocks are created in a string <code>eval()</code>,
they will be executed just as any other <code>END</code> code block of that package
in LIFO order just before the interpreter is being exited.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Inside an <code>END</code> code block, <code>$?</code> contains the value that the program is
going to pass to <code>exit()</code>.  You can modify <code>$?</code> to change the exit
value of the program.  Beware of changing <code>$?</code> by accident (e.g. by
running something via <code>system</code>).</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Inside of a <code>END</code> block, the value of <code>${^GLOBAL_PHASE}</code> will be
<code>&quot;END&quot;</code>.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><code>UNITCHECK</code>, <code>CHECK</code> and <code>INIT</code> code blocks are useful to catch the
transition between the compilation phase and the execution phase of
the main program.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><code>UNITCHECK</code> blocks are run just after the unit which defined them has
been compiled.  The main program file and each module it loads are
compilation units, as are string <code>eval</code>s, run-time code compiled using the
<code>(?{ })</code> construct in a regex, calls to <code>do FILE</code>, <code>require FILE</code>,
and code after the <code>-e</code> switch on the command line.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><code>BEGIN</code> and <code>UNITCHECK</code> blocks are not directly related to the phase of
the interpreter.  They can be created and executed during any phase.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><code>CHECK</code> code blocks are run just after the <B>initial</B> Perl compile phase ends
and before the run time begins, in LIFO order.  <code>CHECK</code> code blocks are used
in the Perl compiler suite to save the compiled state of the program.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Inside of a <code>CHECK</code> block, the value of <code>${^GLOBAL_PHASE}</code> will be
<code>&quot;CHECK&quot;</code>.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><code>INIT</code> blocks are run just before the Perl runtime begins execution, in
&quot;first in, first out&quot; (FIFO) order.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Inside of an <code>INIT</code> block, the value of <code>${^GLOBAL_PHASE}</code> will be <code>&quot;INIT&quot;</code>.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The <code>CHECK</code> and <code>INIT</code> blocks in code compiled by <code>require</code>, string <code>do</code>,
or string <code>eval</code> will not be executed if they occur after the end of the
main compilation phase; that can be a problem in mod_perl and other persistent
environments which use those functions to load code at runtime.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">When you use the <B>-n</B> and <B>-p</B> switches to Perl, <code>BEGIN</code> and
<code>END</code> work just as they do in <B>awk</B>, as a degenerate case.
Both <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>CHECK</code> blocks are run when you use the <B>-c</B>
switch for a compile-only syntax check, although your main code
is not.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The <B>begincheck</B> program makes it all clear, eventually:</p>
<div style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/perl

  # begincheck

  print         &quot;10. Ordinary code runs at runtime.\n&quot;;

  END { print   &quot;16.   So this is the end of the tale.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 7. INIT blocks run FIFO just before runtime.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
    print       &quot; 4.   And therefore before any CHECK blocks.\n&quot;
  }
  CHECK { print &quot; 6.   So this is the sixth line.\n&quot; }

  print         &quot;11.   It runs in order, of course.\n&quot;;

  BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during compilation.\n&quot; }
  END { print   &quot;15.   Read perlmod for the rest of the story.\n&quot; }
  CHECK { print &quot; 5. CHECK blocks run LIFO after all compilation.\n&quot; }
  INIT { print  &quot; 8.   Run this again, using Perl's -c switch.\n&quot; }

  print         &quot;12.   This is anti-obfuscated code.\n&quot;;

  END { print   &quot;14. END blocks run LIFO at quitting time.\n&quot; }
  BEGIN { print &quot; 2.   So this line comes out second.\n&quot; }
  UNITCHECK {
   print &quot; 3. UNITCHECK blocks run LIFO after each file is compiled.\n&quot;
  }
  INIT { print  &quot; 9.   You'll see the difference right away.\n&quot; }

  print         &quot;13.   It only _looks_ like it should be confusing.\n&quot;;
