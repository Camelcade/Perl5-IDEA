code. It is done with the help of <code>ADJUST</code> blocks, which are called in order
of declaration.</p>
<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">They are similar to <code>BEGIN</code> blocks, which run during the compilation of a
package. However, they also have access to <code>$self</code> lexical (object instance)
and all object fields created up to that point.</p>
