value is 1) or not (the value is 0).  This variable is always 1 if the
perl has been compiled without threads.  It is also 1 if this perl is
using thread-safe locale operations.  Note that an individual thread may
choose to use the global locale (generally unsafe) by calling
<a href="psi_element://perlapi%2Fswitch_to_global_locale" style="color:red">switch_to_global_locale in perlapi</a>.  This variable currently is still
set to 1 in such threads.</p>
