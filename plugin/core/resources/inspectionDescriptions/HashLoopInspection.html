<p>Port of SawyerX's <a href="https://github.com/xsawyerx/perl-critic-policy-variables-prohibitlooponhash"><code>Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitLoopOnHash</code></a>
</p>

<p>When "looping over hashes," we mean looping over hash keys or hash values. If you forgot to call keys or values you will accidentally
  loop over both.</p>

<code>
  foreach my $foo (%hash) {...} # not ok
  action() for %hash; # not ok
  foreach my $foo ( keys %hash ) {...} # ok
  action() for values %hash; # ok
</code>

<p>An effort is made to detect expressions:</p>

<code>
  action() for %hash ? keys %hash : (); # ok
  action() for %{ $hash{'stuff'} } ? keys %{ $hash{'stuff'} } : (); # ok
</code>

<p>(Granted, the second example there doesn't make much sense, but I have found a variationo of it in real code.)</p>
