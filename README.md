#Perl5 plugin for Intellij IDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

This project is currently in development, and if you want to participate - you may fork or contact me via skype: hurricup

[Camelcade wiki](https://github.com/hurricup/Perl5-IDEA/wiki)

Optimized using [Java Profiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) from ej-technologies. 

#Need testers
There is tremendous amount of work to do in development and project really need testers. Not only users-testers, but someone
to write tests (mostly for lexer and parser at the moment).

#Current status - development (0.29 beta)
