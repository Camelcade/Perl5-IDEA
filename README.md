#Perl5 plugin for Intellij IDEA - Camelcade

This is my attempt to build a plugin for IDEA that will support Perl5 language.

#Need testers
There is tremendous amount of work to do in development and project really need testers. Not only users-testers, but someone
to write tests (mostly for lexer and parser at the moment).
